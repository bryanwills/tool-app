# tool-app

### This repo is for the starting project of a tool rental service through an app and a website/web app.
### Project is just starting as of March 4th, 2023.
#### Due to inclement weather where I live on March 3rd, 2023, we had horrible storms and winds over 50 mph. Half of our city is without power at this time and it is going to take a long time for the power to be restored due to trees pulling down power lines all over the city. Generators are in short supply from the store and even through Home Depot and Lowe's. I had recently read about the P2P car rental service called Turo and knew about it prior to reading about a young man making $30,000 a month from renting his 8 cars. Since I was unable to locate a generator in time, an idea clicked in my head. Turo but for tools! And here we are.
